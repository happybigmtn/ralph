Operational guide for building and running this project. Keep brief (~60 lines max).

## Build & Run

<!-- Add project-specific build commands here -->
<!-- Examples:
npm install && npm run dev
cargo build --release
make build
-->

## Validation

Run these after implementing to get immediate feedback:

- **Tests**: `[test command]`
- **Typecheck**: `[typecheck command]`
- **Lint**: `[lint command]`

<!-- Examples:
- Tests: `npm test` or `cargo test` or `pytest`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` or `mypy .`
- Lint: `npm run lint` or `cargo clippy`
-->

## Operational Notes
